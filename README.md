# Resources-app
Utility app to bookmark all website links for later use

## Motivation
I am learning webdevelopment from online resources only. This end up me being exposed to a tone of resources **Courses** , **tutorials**, **articles** from resources such as medium , **github repos** reading others codes; and all these resources point to other helpfull sites about free SVGs , wireframe creation websites , color generators and more. All of these websites needed to be visited more than once or may be useful in future to have a collection of such websites could be a big time saver instead of googling everytime and being thrown with 100s of websites again. One way to have this type of collection is bookmark it but this clutter the bookmark bar of the browser also makes it visually unpleasent and in my opinion that also don't give enough importance/emphasis on those resources.
